        <p class="main_text">Considering everything you have to prepare before boarding a flight, do you really want to think about driving to the airport, dealing with traffic, or bothering with parking, when you can depend on our reliable services?&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="main_text">Apex International would love the opportunity to impress you with an airport pickup. Let us pleasantly surprise you. We can make your next airport transfer as seamless as possible. Our professional knowledgeable chauffeurs will gladly take care of all your airport transportation needs. They are exceptionally familiar with all airport sites. </p>
        <p class="main_text">No matter where you travel, whether it's for business or leisure, alone, or with a group, Apex will always provide you with a vehicle to suit your requirements and with consistent service that you can trust. Start your vacation or trip on the right foot by treating yourself to the luxurious accommodations that you deserve. Tell us your return date and we'll take care of that as well! </p>
        <p class="main_text">We offer two simple pickup options. Each solution is tailored differently to suit individual needs. Both choices give you our best service while keeping your costs down. Be sure to tell our reservation agent which option you prefer. We'll do the rest. </p>
        <p class="header5">Inside pickup with a Name-Sign </p>
        <p class="main_text"> Place advance reservation and request to be met inside the terminal. We will monitor your arrival time by checking the flight status online or with a live operator. Your vehicle of choice will be dispatched promptly ahead of the updated arrival time to give the driver sufficient time to park and go inside. If you are arriving on a domestic flight the driver will be waiting for you at the baggage claim area with the passenger's name scrolled on his APEX name sign. For an international flight you will be met right after you clear customs. Remember to always call us immediately, in case you don't see your driver right away. We're sure he's there and we'll be glad to help you locate him. The meet and greet service gives weary travelers an extra bit of reprieve after their flight. Your driver will help you with your baggage so you won't have to do the lugging. As an added bonus, the first 30 minutes of waiting time after the flight arrival is entirely free. </p>
        <p class="header5">Outside pickup, car waiting curbside </p>
        <p class="main_text">Place advance reservation and request to be met curbside at the passenger pickup area outside the terminal. We will monitor your arrival time by checking the flight status online or with a live operator. Upon landing, call us to find out your car number before walking out of the terminal. Once you have the car number you may go directly to the designated pick-up spot. In the event that you don't see your driver right away, call our dispatch office immediately. The dispatcher will coordinate a meeting point and stay on the line with you until you encounter your driver. We never miss a client. </p>
        <p class="header5">Airport Policy </p>
        <p class="main_text">Although we verify all arrival times directly with your airline, it is unfortunately impossible to guarantee the accuracy of airline provided information. Therefore, we advise you to call us if you're aware of any irregular changes with your flight schedule. The standard Apex waiting time policy applies on all pickups. Waiting time is chargeable if the car has not been released and the flight is delayed beyond the updated time posted by the airline. Cars are normally held 30 minutes past the updated arrival time for domestic flights, and 60 minutes for international flights. However, Apex will wait for you as long as it takes. Remember to summarily call us, just in case you cannot find your car. We promise the car will be there. You may use our toll free 800 number: 800-APEX-484. Passengers leaving without notifying us will be charged a no-show. </p>
        <p class="header4" style="color:blue">We are glad to be at your service, your security and safety is very important to us.<br />
                                              Enjoy a luxurious limousine like no other from the moment you arrive to the moment you depart</p>
