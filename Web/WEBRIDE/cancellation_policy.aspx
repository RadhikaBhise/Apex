<p class="main_text">At Apex Limousines, we take pride in our punctual, upscale, and considerate service. </p>
<p class="main_text">Since we strive to give you the best possible service, we make it our business to treat your reservation order with serious attention. Please keep in mind that there is always a cost associated with routing a vehicle to any pickup point. Drivers are self-employed and bear their own expenses of gas, tolls, licensing, insurance, vehicle maintenance, and an occasional baseless traffic summons. Their time is valuable just like everyone else's. </p>
<p class="main_text">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="main_text">We will never cancel on you, and in return all we expect is that you will always notify us on time in case you need to cancel on us. </p>
<p class="main_text"><u>To avoid being charged a no-show you must contact us in advance to cancel within a reasonable amount of time before the pickup time. </u></p>
<p class="main_text">** You must obtain a cancellation number or you will be charged the full fare. ** </p>
<p class="main_text">Reservations must be cancelled 1 hour prior to pick up time in New York City and 2 hours prior for an out of town reservation. Please have your confirmation number handy in order to easily reference your reservation and expedite your cancellation. </p>
<p class="main_text">Cancellation notification may be done by any of the following various ways: </p>
<ul class="main_text">
  <li>Phone Cancellation 1 - 2 hours in advance </li>
  <li>Fax your cancellation 2 hours in advance </li>
  <li>Email your cancellation 3 hours in advance </li>
</ul>
<p class="main_text">Intl. Reservations: Cancellations must be received no less than 48 hours prior to pickup time. Roundtrip orders must be cancelled as 2 separate orders. </p>
<p class="main_text">Bus cancellations must be made a minimum of 72 hours prior to reservation time. </p>
<p class="main_text">If you fail to cancel by the prescribed time frames prior to your pickup time you will be charged in full for the order. </p>
<p class="header2" align="center" style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">: : NO-SHOWS: :</p>
<p class="main_text">ALL no shows will be charged the full rate. The full fare rate also applies for an out of town pick up. If a passenger requests us to hold the car for a longer period but fails to take the ride, additional waiting time charges will be added to the standard ¡®No Show' charges. <br>
    <br />
  If by chance you miss your flight or can't find our driver at the airport, please call us immediately at our toll free number <strong>800-APEX-484 </strong>, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week or you will be charged a no-show in full for the car and the wait time. </p>
