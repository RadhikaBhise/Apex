        <p class="main_text">The national affiliate network was originally developed as a service for our nationwide traveling clients who sought better comportment from transportation companies at their destination cities. It has since been expanded globally to include trustworthy reputable affiliates in Canada , Mexico , Europe, and Asia . The establishment of a global network gives all Apex account holders worldwide access to high level service. </p>
      
        <p class="main_text">Over the years, Apex has gradually built up its vast network by rigorously screening all eligible affiliates in each participating city. Members were carefully selected for admission based on performance and affordability. We work only with the most qualified vendors that meet our standards, to bring you superior service at a reasonable price. </p>
       
        <p class="main_text">Booking worldwide ground transportation through Apex gives you an advantage over booking with a foreign company on your own. The member affiliates in our network are motivated to perform to the best of their capabilities by the prospect of maintaining a continuous business relationship. By steering a substantial flow of business volume in their direction we create a compelling byproduct of leverage. As a corporate entity this enables us to quickly use disciplinary measures if someone disappoints our customers. Another benefit to you, the client, is that we work with members on consignment payment terms. This is an effective mechanism to keep service performance high. We can withhold or retract payment if someone does not adhere to our strict standards. Many of our customers find this arrangement appealing because they know that as a corporation, Apex can exert better control over a foreign transportation company than an individual. </p>
        
        <p class="main_text">Apex obviates the need to research and plan your transfer from the airport in your destination city. In addition, our network gives you access to quality transportation throughout the course of your stay. We have already done all the homework for you. All that remains is for you to entrust us with your care. Because we deeply value your business you can rest assured that we'll do everything within our power to keep you happy.
