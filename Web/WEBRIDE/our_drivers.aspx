            <p class="title">Our Drivers</p>
            <p class="main_text">
                  Our drivers are seasoned, dedicated professionals with years of chauffeur experience. They are fully qualified and readily available to rapidly respond to all transportation requests. The drivers that we employ understand their vital role in treating our customers respectfully with the highest degree of gracious service. Many of them are multi-lingual and have an average of over ten years in the transportation business. Our drivers undergo 3 phases of training before starting work: defensive driving, geography, & etiquette. 
            </p>
            <p class="main_text">
                  At Apex our utmost concern is passenger safety. Drivers are taught defensive driving techniques to keep them more alert through the practice of anticipating what other drivers will do at a moment’s notice. Safety awareness is heavily stressed along with preventive mechanical maintenance. Beyond the benefits of lowering insurance premiums, dismissing tickets, and reducing points on driving records, drivers are motivated on their own to successfully complete this course. 
            </p>
            <p class="main_text">
                  Street-smart navigation starts with efficient route planning. Before we permit our drivers to take you anywhere they must demonstrate proficient geographic competency.  In geography class drivers are thoroughly examined to determine the extent of their geographic knowledge of major highways, main roadways, metropolitan streets, popular landmark locations, and the most efficient alternate routes during rush hours or periods of heavy traffic congestion. Applicants who are determined to be lacking in knowledge undergo extensive instruction until they exhibit satisfactory understanding of all the required areas. 
            </p>
            <p class="main_text">
                  During etiquette training drivers are told about the importance of personal hygiene. They are shown several short films discussing the proper tone, gestures, professional conduct, & temperament that convey a happy radiant attitude. Most importantly, they are ingrained with the outlook that “the customer is always right”. 
            </p>
            <p class="main_text">
                  Drivers are not cleared to start working until their course completions are certified and their knowledge is verifiably confirmed.
